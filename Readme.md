Longhorn Repo - Collaborators : feren, Elbullazul, Cinnamoner (Coming soon & WIP)

<h1>A collab to make ports of most of the Longhorn builds' themes work in Linux</h1>
This repo will contain theme sets for most Longhorn builds to emulate the look of them as much as possible in Cinnamon, that includes:

Vista Beta 2 Windows Basic (often referred to as "Old Windows Basic") (by Elbullazul)

Longhorn 4074 Aero (with Aero Express from Beta 2's titlebar BG and borders as Cinnamon has no Windows transparency unlike Emerald (deprecated), Compiz, etc) (by feren)

Longhorn 405X+ Slate Theme

Longhorn Plex V.2.0 (Last version of Plex before Slate was introduced)

Longhorn 4074 Icon Set (by feren)

Longhorn 4074 Jade (by feren)
